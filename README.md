# Typelixir

The library proposes a typing system that makes possible to perform static type-checking on a significant fragment of Elixir. 

An important feature of the typing system is that it does not require any syntactic change to the language. Type information is provided by means of function signatures `@spec`.

The approach is inspired by the so-called [gradual typing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradual_typing).

The proposed typing system is based on subtyping and is backwards compatible, as it allows the presence of non-typed code fragments. Represented as the `any` type.

The code parts that are not statically type checked because of lack of typing information, will be type checked then at runtime.

[Here](./lib/example/EXAMPLE.md) are some examples of usages.

### Note

The library is not extensive within the language. The scope of this work is to cover the expectations of a degree project for the [Facutlad de IngenierÃ­a - UDELAR](https://www.fing.edu.uy/). 

Special thanks to our tutors Marcos Viera and Alberto Pardo.
